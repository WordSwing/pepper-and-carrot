# Pepper and Carrot

Narrative for practicing Chinese to accompany the Pepper and Carrot comics.

We thought the [Pepper and Carrot](https://www.peppercarrot.com/) open source
comics would be a great tool for practicing Chinese, as they provide some
delightful visual context for reading and can go a long way to making study
more fun. But the narrative of the comic itself is often rather sparse, and is
not tuned to a learner's needs.

You can find an interactive version of these sentences at
<a href="https://wordswing.com/cards/comics">WordSwing</a> or you can download
them yourself and study however you like.

We thus have started adding our own narrative to accompany the comics that we
hope will provide some additional reading practice to go along with the comics.
